I'm Russel Musasa, a passionate Software Engineer. I believe that information technology can improve the lives of our communities and our business processes when used efficiently, wisely and with committement.

As a software engineer I have worked with advanced topics of Java programming, web development and systems Integrations. I recently worked in development of a web application module for a web banking, which enable customers to send money from their debit account or debit card to recipient card anywhere in the world using Visa Direct Platform. In that project I used skills like APIs Integrations, customer information security management by implementing message level encryption, as well as compliance by implementing checking feature for blacklisted names. I also support Integrations with partner's systems using emerging technologies like REST/SOAP APIs. This is just some of many others projects and activities I have been working on. The goal is as always to make customer's life easier and bring profit to the companies I have been working for, and I'm ready to discuss on those fantastic projects details.

Acquiring DevOps skills has been definitely one of the big steps of my career as a software engineer, and for me the next step of my career is to get a role as a DevOps Engineer.
